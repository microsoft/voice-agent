# Voice Agent samples

Choose a sample to learn how to create, connect, and extend a Foundry Voice
Agent. This directory includes Python, C#, Java, browser, and end-to-end
application samples, plus a design guide.

Start with the sample's linked documentation for its prerequisites, supported
regions, model choices, and run commands. The [common Python setup](#common-python-sample-setup)
below applies to the top-level Python scripts; directory-based samples may have
their own dependencies and setup.

For the general browser UI, use the local
[`portal/`](../portal/README.md). For the Finance CLI samples and the
independent shared MCP reference implementation, start with the
[Finance documentation index](../docs/README.md).

**Default Portal Templates use the public no-auth MCP.** Local MCP hosting,
Dev Tunnel, `setup-local-examples.sh`, and local E2E are optional development
paths, not prerequisites for browsing, publishing, or trying Templates.
Finance CLI examples have separate managed-MCP configuration requirements;
an existing customer-hosted MCP does not need a local tunnel.

## Choose a sample

Choose by **the use case you want to show**, then open the project link for
setup, model choices, and an example conversation. The tables distinguish the
caller's goal from what actually happens in the demonstration.

For a mobile customer presentation or a general-purpose browser conversation,
start with **First Voice**. For industry workflows in the Portal, use the
numbered business templates below.

- [Browser, mobile, and multimodal experiences](#browser-mobile-and-multimodal-experiences)
- [Banking, support, and reception](#banking-support-and-reception)
- [Sales, appointments, and travel](#sales-appointments-and-travel)
- [Employee services, learning, and research](#employee-services-learning-and-research)
- [Developer building blocks and integrations](#developer-building-blocks-and-integrations)
- [Transcription, evaluation, and operations](#transcription-evaluation-and-operations)

**Demo boundaries:** Examples 5-34 use mock tools with fictional results on the
public no-auth `/mcp/mock-tool-call` route by default. They can demonstrate
booking, messaging, or ticket creation, but nothing is booked, sent, charged,
or filed in a real business system. Use fictional information only. Other
samples have their own integration requirements and limitations, noted below
and in their READMEs. To connect actual systems, see
[Connect real tools](../docs/05_connect_real_tools.md).

In the business templates, **handoff** normally means moving between stages
of the agent's workflow, not transferring a telephone call to a person.
Actual phone transfer requires a supporting telephony runtime.

### Realtime sample: Project region, model, and GPU routing

Examples 1 and 2 use 400 ms `azure_semantic_vad` silence. Examples 3–34 use Example 1's turn
detection (`profile: normal`, explicit barge-in thresholds, `end_of_utterance_detection: null`,
no server echo cancellation) with 600 ms silence.
Most use `gpt-realtime`; Finance Realtime uses `gpt-realtime-regional` and
Finance Cascade uses `gpt-4.1-mini`. Each card has a single version, its root
`agent.json`. Runtime configuration does not by itself establish improved
measured latency or VAD safety.

The separate regional samples below intentionally document their own model
and Project requirements; they are not additional Portal template versions.

| Foundry Project region | Model to select | GPU inference location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| East US 2 (`eastus2`) | `gpt-realtime-2.1-datazone` | Within the US data zone; not necessarily East US 2 specifically. |
| Japan East (`japaneast`) | `azure-realtime` | Japan East, with service-team-confirmed routing for the selected Project. |
| Central India (`centralindia`) | `gpt-realtime` | Standard (regional) processing in Central India, per the public model/region table; Voice Agent eligibility must be confirmed separately. |

**East US 2 Project: use the Data Zone model to keep inference on US GPUs.
Japan East Foundry Project: use Azure Realtime with confirmed Japan East GPU routing.**
The Japan East routing confirmation is Project-specific, not a guarantee for
every Japan-region Project or a change to the public Global Standard
classification. See the [full setup and commands](realtime_datazone_voice_agent.md).
For Central India, use the exact `gpt-realtime` model, not `gpt-realtime-2.1`
(the latter is listed as Global Standard there). The public table currently
does not list Agent support in Central India; confirm enablement before running
this voice-first Agent sample.

## Choose the right setup

The Voice Live migration, Finance, Elevator, language-learning, vehicle-local-tools, image-input, long-tool-wait, and documentation-generated voice web
samples use their own `requirements.txt` files. The voice web sample uses a standalone HTTP/WebSocket
backend and does not require the Projects SDK; follow its README for setup.
The common Python SDK samples require `azure-ai-projects>=2.7.0` from PyPI.

The GPT Live samples in `gpt_live/` share one `.env`. The Python terminal samples in
`gpt_live/python/` use their own `samples/gpt_live/python/.venv` with pinned packages and a
bundled preview `azure-ai-projects` 2.11.0 wheel from `dist/` for the GPT Live agent models
and Live WebSocket client; that preview changes APIs other samples use, so keep it out of the
shared `.venv`. The browser sample in `gpt_live/js/` uses Node.js 22+ and
the bundled preview `@azure/ai-projects` package from `dist/` instead. Follow their READMEs
for configuration and installation.

The SIP sample in `sip_voice_agent/` is standalone and uses its own
`requirements.txt` and local `.env`. Follow its README for SIP client/PBX setup;
it does not open a local microphone or require the Projects SDK or PortAudio.

## Common Python sample prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later.
- An Azure AI Foundry Project endpoint:
  `https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>`.
- Azure CLI sign-in (`az login`) or another `DefaultAzureCredential` identity.
- A microphone, speakers or headset, and PortAudio for the audio samples.
- Azure AI Projects SDK 2.7.0 or later, installed by the requirements below.

## Common Python sample setup

Run these commands from the parent `VoiceAgent` directory.

PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r samples\requirements.txt
if (-not (Test-Path samples\.env)) { Copy-Item samples\.env.example samples\.env }
```

Linux, macOS, or WSL2:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r samples/requirements.txt
[ -f samples/.env ] || cp samples/.env.example samples/.env
```

The single `pip install` command installs every common Python sample
dependency, including Projects SDK 2.7.0 or later with its `[voice]`
dependencies. No Azure SDK source checkout or Voice Live SDK is required.

For an existing preview or source installation, rerun the requirements install
command above to replace it with the released SDK.

Set the Project endpoint in `samples/.env`:

```dotenv
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_ENDPOINT=https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_MODEL=gpt-realtime
```

## Run the agent samples

Run a sample without an Agent-name argument to create a new Agent. Pass an
existing Agent name to skip creation and use its stored model, audio,
instructions, and tools:

```text
python samples/<sample-name>.py
python samples/<sample-name>.py <agent-name>
```

On Linux, macOS, or WSL2, use `.venv/bin/python` if the virtual environment is
not activated. You can alternatively set `AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_AGENT_NAME` in
`samples/.env`.

### Simple REST creation

The REST sample puts the Agent name in the URL and sends the description and
definition to the same version-creation endpoint used by the SDK:

```text
POST <project-endpoint>/agents/<agent-name>/versions?api-version=v1
Authorization: <Entra token>
Foundry-Features: VoiceAgents=V1Preview
Content-Type: application/json
```

Run:

```text
python samples/simple_rest_lifecycle.py
```

### Basic Agent: create, version, and microphone chat

The basic sample uses `VoiceAgentDefinition` and the audio/tool models from
`azure.ai.projects.models`. It creates an Agent version through
`AIProjectClient` with preview features enabled:

```python
from azure.ai.projects.aio import AIProjectClient

async with AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=credential,
    allow_preview=True,
) as client:
    version = await client.agents.create_version(
        agent_name=agent_name,
        definition=definition,
    )
```

To update the definition, call `client.agents.create_version` again with the
same Agent name. The returned version identifier is `version.version`.
Retrieve an existing Agent with `client.agents.get(agent_name=agent_name)`.
The same Projects client opens the Voice Agent realtime session:

```python
async with client.beta.voice_agents.realtime.connect(agent_name=agent_name) as connection:
    await connection.input_audio_buffer.append(audio=pcm_bytes)
    async for event in connection:
        # Handle transcripts, audio, and tool events.
        ...
```

The SDK owns authentication, the Agent WebSocket URL, and the
`Foundry-Features: VoiceAgents=V1Preview` header. No private URL overrides or
Voice Live SDK imports are needed. The Agent's stored definition controls the
session; the samples do not send a replacement `session.update`.

See the upstream [Voice Agent SDK samples](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/azure-ai-projects_2.7.0/sdk/ai/azure-ai-projects/samples/agents/voice)
for additional realtime usage.

Audio output uses a voice-name string and a separate `voice_type`, for example
`VoiceAgentAudioOutputConfig(voice="en-US-AvaNeural",
voice_type=VoiceType.AZURE_STANDARD)`.

Microphone samples use `RealtimeServerEventType` from
`azure.ai.projects.models` for event dispatch, including `SESSION_CREATED` and
`RESPONSE_OUTPUT_AUDIO_DELTA`. They follow the new Voice Agent protocol,
without legacy audio-event aliases.

```text
python samples/basic_voice_agent.py
```

### MCP with live microphone audio

The MCP tool references a Foundry Project connection that stores the target and
authentication configuration:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server_label": "my-mcp-server",
  "project_connection_id": "<project-connection-id>",
  "require_approval": "never"
}
```

Do not put MCP credentials in the Agent definition. Create a Foundry Project
connection for the MCP server, then set:

```dotenv
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_MCP_CONNECTION_ID=<project-connection-id>
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_MCP_SERVER_LABEL=my-mcp-server
```

Run:

```text
python samples/voice_agent_with_mcp.py
```

Speak a request that the MCP tools can answer. Press Ctrl+C to finish. The
sample prints the persisted conversation ID.

### Foundry IQ with live microphone audio

A Foundry IQ knowledge base is represented as an MCP tool with its
knowledge-base URL and Project connection:

```json
{
  "type": "mcp",
  "server_label": "foundry-iq",
  "server_url": "https://<search-service>.search.windows.net/knowledgebases/<knowledge-base>/mcp?api-version=<version>",
  "project_connection_id": "<project-connection-id>",
  "require_approval": "never"
}
```

Set:

```dotenv
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_FOUNDRY_IQ_URL=https://<search-service>.search.windows.net/knowledgebases/<knowledge-base>/mcp?api-version=<version>
AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_FOUNDRY_IQ_CONNECTION_ID=<project-connection-id>
```

Run:

```text
python samples/voice_agent_with_foundry_iq.py
```

Ask a question covered by the knowledge base. Use a headset to reduce echo;
talk over the Agent to test barge-in and press Ctrl+C to finish.

### Client-executed local function

A `function` tool is executed by the connected client. After the function-call
response's `response.done` event, the sample sends a typed
`RealtimeConversationItemFunctionCallOutput` and requests the model's follow-up
response. Waiting avoids a concurrent-response error.

```text
python samples/voice_agent_with_local_function.py
```

Say: **"Add 5 and 7. You must use the add_numbers function."** The sample
executes Python locally, prints `{"sum": 12.0}`, returns the result to the
session, and plays the spoken answer.

### Foundry Toolbox

A `toolbox` tool references a versioned Foundry Toolbox:

```json
{
  "type": "toolbox",
  "toolbox_name": "voice-agent-toolbox-azure-search",
  "toolbox_version": "1"
}
```

Toolbox calls are surfaced through MCP events, allowing clients to display the
tool name, arguments, and structured output. Configure the Toolbox name and
version in `samples/.env`, then run:

```text
python samples/voice_agent_with_toolbox.py
```

## Tracing and evaluation

When a conversation ends, use the URL printed in the terminal log to view the
trace in the Azure AI Foundry portal and run evaluations.

## Download conversation and audio

Microphone samples capture the top-level `conversation_id` from the
`session.created` event and print it when the session ends. Copy the printed
Agent name and conversation ID and run:

```text
python samples/download_conversation_artifacts.py <agent-name> <conversation-id>
```

The downloader waits for persistence to complete and writes:

```text
voice-agent-output/<conversation-id>/
|-- conversation.json
|-- merged.wav
`-- turns/
    |-- 001_user_<item-id>.wav
    |-- 002_agent_<item-id>.wav
    `-- ...
```

- `conversation.json` contains the conversation envelope, responses, ordered
  items, and audio metadata.
- `turns/` contains every persisted user and assistant audio segment.
- `merged.wav` is the final stereo recording: caller on the left channel and
  Agent on the right.

Set `AZURE_VOICE_AGENTS_OUTPUT_DIR` in `samples/.env` to change the output
directory. For bring-your-own storage, the JSON manifest records returned blob
URIs instead of downloading WAV data through the service.

Conversation and audio download requires the Agent to have been created with
`store=true`. All Agents created by these common samples enable it.

## Contributor resources

### Adding samples and portal templates

Use underscores between words in sample directory names, including subagent
examples.

Every example intended for the portal Templates page must follow
[Add an example to Portal Templates](./PORTAL_TEMPLATE_EXAMPLES.md). New
sample directories are not discovered automatically; they require the
documented portable `agent.json`, explicit allowlist entry, security rules,
tests, and source-sync update when applicable.

### Reusable coding-agent skills

The related workflows are under [`../skills/`](../skills/):

- [`debug-local-session`](../skills/debug-local-session/) resolves and analyzes
  recordings created by the portal.
- [`voice-agent-preview`](../skills/voice-agent-preview/) creates and tests
  Voice Agents with Projects SDK 2.7.0 and its preview voice APIs.
- `provision-foundry-iq` creates a Foundry IQ knowledge base from local files.
- `provision-foundry-toolbox` creates an Azure AI Search index and Foundry
  Toolbox.

### Validate without Azure access

With the common sample dependencies installed, run from `VoiceAgent`:

```text
python -m compileall -q samples skills
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests exercise the released SDK's WebSocket handshake, authentication and
preview headers, PCM serialization, event decoding, function-call ordering,
Agent versioning, and conversation/audio downloads. Only network and microphone
boundaries are mocked; the tests use the real Projects SDK. They do not create
Azure resources or open the microphone.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `401` or `403` | Sign in again and confirm Project access. |
| `404` during create or connect | Confirm preview enablement and region support. |
| Model not found | Set a voice-capable managed model or Foundry deployment. |
| MCP or Foundry IQ call fails | Verify the connection target, credential, and service reachability. |
| Microphone sample cannot start | Install PortAudio and `pyaudio`, then confirm microphone permission. |
| Trace query returns `403` | Grant the signed-in identity permission to query the Application Insights resource or its linked Log Analytics workspace. |

Never place access tokens, API keys, or connection secrets in source files.
Use Foundry Project connections or environment-based credentials.

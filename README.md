## What's New

Voice Agent is now available in **public preview**, making voice a first-class modality in Foundry Agent Service. We've received great feedback from customers and are working with them to move their voice agents into production as we prepare for general availability (GA).

# Voice Agent and Voice Live

[Voice Live](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live) is the foundation for real-time voice interaction, and Voice Agent builds on that foundation to deliver complete voice-first agents. Voice Live handles the real-time voice experience, while Voice Agent adds the intelligence, tools, knowledge, and orchestration required to build end-to-end agentic applications.

For most customers building voice-first agents, we recommend starting with Voice Agent. Voice Agent provides the more complete, integrated experience for building and operating an agent, bringing together voice, reasoning, instructions, knowledge, tools, and orchestration. Voice Live is a better fit when customers already have their own agent stack and primarily need real-time voice capabilities with greater control over the voice application architecture.

## Voice Agent Quality And Scalability

### Latency

Speech-to-speech models can achieve latency as low as **500 ms** on service side. Cascaded pipelines (**STT → LLM → TTS**) can also deliver low latency < 1s with the right LLM and streaming speech configuration. Actual latency depends on the model, region, network conditions, and tool calls.

### Speech and model quality

Voice Agent brings together advanced speech and language models, including [GPT Realtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/voice-live-how-to), [GPT Live](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/openai/concepts/gpt-live), Azure speech-to-text and [HD voices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=text-to-speech), and MAI Transcribe and MAI Voice. Choose the combination that best fits your languages, domain, and conversational experience.

Recent speech benchmark references:

- **2026.10** [MAI-Transcribe-2-Streaming benchmark results](https://microsoft.ai/news/our-first-streaming-transcription-model/) — Microsoft reports first place for final and partial transcript accuracy on Artificial Analysis in its October 1 announcement.

## Voice Agent Extended Samples

### Start here

This directory is the entry point for the Voice Agent portal, runnable samples,
the Finance reference workflow, and its shared MCP service. Detailed setup and
operation instructions live with the component that owns them; this file routes
users and coding agents to the correct entry point.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **On Windows, use WSL2 for this repository.** Do not run the repository
> setup or runtime workflow from native PowerShell or Command Prompt, and do
> not use a checkout mounted under `/mnt/c/`. Start WSL2, clone the repository
> into the WSL Linux filesystem (for example, `~/src/voice-agent`),
> and run all repository commands from WSL. Use the Windows browser to open
> the resulting `localhost` UI and grant microphone permission.

The standalone [audio rewrite and translation sample](samples/audio_file_rewrite/README.md)
also supports native Windows PowerShell with Python 3.11+, without WSL.

For an unqualified request such as **"run the UI"** or **"start the portal"**,
use [`portal/`](portal/README.md). It is the general Voice Agent UI and runs on
`http://127.0.0.1:9527` by default. Do not start the Finance MCP stack unless
the request mentions Finance, Templates, or the shared MCP.

### Portal + local MCP quickstart

Use this path when the portal must publish or run the checked-in Templates.
It is the recommended end-to-end Linux/WSL workflow:

```bash
cd /path/to/voice-agent
az login
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh \
   --project-endpoint "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
./scripts/login-devtunnel.sh
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh --check
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh restart
```

`login-devtunnel.sh` uses GitHub device-code authentication. Follow the printed
`https://github.com/login/device` prompt. Azure operations continue to use the
separate identity selected by `az login`.

Success requires `local_mcp_and_portal=ready`. Open
**http://localhost:18098**, then verify with:

```bash
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh status
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18003/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:18098/healthz
```

Port `9527` is only for a portal-only session without the managed local MCP
lifecycle. Do not run a second manual portal after this quickstart.

### Instructions for coding agents

When the user asks to run or debug something from this directory:

1. Verify that commands will run on Linux. For a Windows user, require a WSL2
   checkout in the WSL filesystem. If the checkout is under `/mnt/c/` or the
   terminal is native Windows, stop and guide the user to clone and reopen the
   repository in WSL2 before continuing. Exception: the standalone
   `samples/audio_file_rewrite/` sample supports native Windows; follow its README.
2. Select the component from the table above and read its `README.md` before
   running commands.
3. Treat **UI** without a qualifier as the general [`portal/`](portal/README.md).
4. Treat **Finance UI**, **portal Templates with Finance**, or
   **shared MCP UI** as the workflow documented in
   [`docs/03_run_samples.md`](docs/03_run_samples.md).
5. Reuse an existing component-local `.env` and virtual environment when they
   are valid. Never copy credentials or endpoints between unrelated `.env`
   files without the user's intent.
6. Start servers as long-running processes, verify their `/healthz` endpoint,
   and report the browser URL and log location. Do not report success merely
   because a process was spawned.
7. Do not silently fall back to mock data or a different Azure Project when
   authentication, endpoint, model, or preview checks fail.

For the default portal route, follow [`portal/README.md`](portal/README.md) to
prepare `portal/.env` and its `.venv`, start `portal/demo_server.py`, then
verify:

```text
GET http://127.0.0.1:9527/healthz
```

For the complete Finance route, follow the ordered
[`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) workflow. The normal lifecycle commands are:

```bash
./scripts/setup-local-examples.sh --project-endpoint "https://<account>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<project>"
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh restart
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh status
./scripts/manage-local-mcp-and-ui.sh stop
```

The setup command installs Node.js 22 and the Dev Tunnel CLI under the ignored
`.local-mcp-and-ui/tools/` directory when they are missing. It also supports
minimal Linux Python installations that provide `venv` but omit `ensurepip`:
each component environment receives its own bootstrapped `pip`. No `sudo` or
system package change is required for those three tools. Azure CLI must already
be installed and authenticated; Dev Tunnel device-code authentication remains
an explicit user action because setup must not authenticate as an identity the
user did not choose.

### Platform support

The supported repository working environment is Linux. On a Windows computer,
use **WSL2 for the entire repository workflow**, including the portal, samples,
MCP, deployment, and validation commands. The standalone
[`audio_file_rewrite` sample](samples/audio_file_rewrite/README.md) is an exception
and can run and be tested directly in Windows PowerShell:

1. Start a supported WSL2 Linux distribution.
2. Clone this repository again into the WSL filesystem, for example under
   `~/src/`. Do not run the workflow from a Windows checkout mounted under
   `/mnt/c/`.
3. Install Git, Python 3.10+, and Azure CLI inside WSL, then authenticate Azure
   CLI. The local setup script can install repository-local Node.js 22 and Dev
   Tunnel CLI copies. Azure Developer CLI is needed only for deployment.
   Windows-side CLI login state is not assumed to be shared.
4. The local setup, MCP E2E, and lifecycle scripts use native Python and never
   invoke Docker. Install Docker only when deliberately running the separate
   `shared_mcp/scripts/package.sh` image-packaging command; Azure Container
   Apps deployment uses a remote build.
5. Open the WSL checkout with VS Code Remote - WSL and run all commands from
   its WSL terminal.
6. Open the resulting `localhost` URL in the Windows browser; browser
   microphone permission remains on the Windows side.

Some individual component documents retain native PowerShell commands because
their code can run independently on Windows. They are not the recommended or
supported end-to-end repository workflow. Except for the standalone sample above,
native Windows execution, WSL1, and
running the checkout from `/mnt/c/` are outside the supported path.

### Security and environment boundaries

- Configure only Azure resources and identities the customer is authorized to
  use.
- Never place access tokens, API keys, connection secrets, or customer data in
  source files.
- Use Foundry Project connections or environment-based credentials.
- The portal and samples use Azure Foundry; running the local portal does not run
  the Azure voice service locally.
- Review each component's persistence and recording behavior before using
  sensitive prompts, audio, transcripts, or tool output.
